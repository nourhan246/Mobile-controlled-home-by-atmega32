# Mobile-controlled-home-by-atmega32
The system allows controlling the home by mobile phone application through Bluetooth. Two subsystems are implemented; Safety door that could be opened by the mobile application by entering user name and password, and light on/off that could be controlled also by the mobile phone. The system supports 10 users with different names and password. In case of entering the name of the password 3 times wrong, the system should give alarm.
